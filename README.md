Foursquare panel
----------

**TL;DR A web app for batch-editing Foursquare venues.**

The app is running [here](http://panel.alexey.ch) and is accessible
only to Foursquare SU3s because of the fabulous
[whitelist](https://github.com/appplemac/foursquare-panel/blob/master/helpers.rb#L13).

Pull requests are very welcome, as for the last few months I have been
trying to deal with bugs throughout the application (and, taking into
account that I am writing this, failed to do so).

Thanks to [Ariom Komolov](http://about.me/komolov) for the initial idea,
and to the amazing team of all Foursquare SU3s, including Artiom, for
thorougly testing it and providing me with excellent feedback. :heart:
